# Virtual Pet

Say hello to your very own tiny gray kitty, right in your browser. Name it, feed it, and try not to fur-get about it — it gets hungry over time!

## 🐱 What is this?

A small, cozy single-page web app:

* Adopt a virtual gray cat.
* Give it a name.
* Feed it to keep it purr-fectly happy.
* Its mood changes if you ignore it too long.
* It remembers its name and last meal, even if you close the page.
